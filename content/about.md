# Hi there

My name is Paolo and I'm the owner of this blog. I'm a Computer Scientist and Software Engineer, mostly focused on the backend.
I'm also quite interested in Cybersecurity and multimedia programming. On this blog you will find TILs and writeups as well as reviews and 
personal insights on everything revolving around software.
