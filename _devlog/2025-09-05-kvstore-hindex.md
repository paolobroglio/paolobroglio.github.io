I'm currently [working on a key-value store](https://github.com/paolobroglio/kvstore) while reading [Design Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/) by Martin Kleppmann. BTW it's a great book!

I'm also trying to create a benchmarking framework around it for testing different indexes implementations and evaluating the store's performances.
