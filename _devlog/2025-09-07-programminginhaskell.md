### Diving Deeper into Haskell

Recently, my colleagues and I worked through [Algebra Driven Design](https://leanpub.com/algebra-driven-design) by Sandy Maguire at work. The book proved to be an excellent exploration of abstraction's power, demonstrating key concepts through compelling real-world examples. While it's heavily focused on Haskell, the insights translated well beyond the language itself.

The implementation sections challenged me considerably. Haskell's syntax still feels unfamiliar but the struggle was worthwhile. Algebra Driven Design opened my eyes to the elegance of functional programming and sparked a genuine curiosity about advanced FP concepts and the benefits of robust type systems.

This experience convinced me it was time to tackle Haskell more systematically.

### Programming in Haskell

[Programming in Haskell](https://people.cs.nott.ac.uk/pszgmh/pih.html) by [Graham Hutton](https://people.cs.nott.ac.uk/pszgmh/) has been sitting on my reading list for months. With my renewed interest in functional programming, now feels like the perfect time to dive in.

I'm planning to work through the exercises methodically and document my solutions [here](https://github.com/paolobroglio/programming-in-haskell-solutions). Looking forward to building a stronger foundation in Haskell and seeing where this journey leads.
